## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The included python notebook file in this repo should run with Anaconda distribution of Python versions 3.*.

To explore this project please download the data folder with three JSON datasets and the python notebook.

You can either upload the notebook file and the data folder containing the JSON files using the Jupyter notebook which will automatically place these files in the current working directory of your Python installation or place these files in the current working directory and then run the notebooks.

Hint: To check for the current working directory using the available notebooks just type os.getcwd() in a cell and run it. If you would like to change the current working directory before running these notebooks, use the os.chdir function, e.g. if your current working path is c:\projects, the statement you would want to execute is os.chdir("c:&#92;&#92;projects").
